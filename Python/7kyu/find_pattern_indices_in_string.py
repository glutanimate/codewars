Find the motif in DNA sequence.

In genetics, a sequenceâ€™s motif is a nucleotides (or amino-acid) sequence pattern. Sequence motifs have a biological significance. For more information you can take a look here.

For this kata you need to complete the function motif_locator. This function receives 2 arguments - a sequence and a motif. Both arguments are strings.

You should return an array that contains all the start positions of the motif (in order). A sequence may contain 0 or more repetitions of the given motif. Note that the number of the first position is 1, not 0.

Some examples:

For the sequence "ACGTGGGGACTAGGGG" and the motif "GGGG" the result should be [5, 13].
For the sequence "ACCGTACCAAGGGACC" and the motif "AAT" the result should be []
For the sequence "GGG" and the motif "GG" the result should be [1, 2]
