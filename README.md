## Codewars

A collection of my solutions to [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) programming challenges ('katas').

The files are grouped by programming language and difficulty, 8 kyu being the easiest and 1 kyu the hardest. Each file name usually alludes to the topic of the problem.

I've only recently started keeping track of my solutions offline, and mostly just for katas with 6 kyu and lower, so this repo is by no means complete. For an overview of all the kata I've solved, feel free to click on the badge below:
